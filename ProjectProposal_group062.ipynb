    "Our study focuses on the relationship between susceptibility to misinformation and reduced mask wearing & social distancing. During the current pandemic, misinformation has been running rampant among social media platforms and mass media platforms, often becoming a partisan issue between political parties. The source and backing of the misinformation will also be studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior Work:\n",
    "We began with an interest in exploring how individualsâ€™ exposure to different media might change their perception of COVID related information. We examined research published in Nature which focused on the differences in attitudes across countries based on how much trust respondents had in government media outlets. Additionally, we were interested in the effects of political outlook attitudes towards utilization of masks; there  is a correlation between having right-leaning political attitudes and expressing belief in conspiratorial views. We wanted to combine these two strands and explore the relationship between attitudes and mask wearing practices.\n",
